Question: Show names for all stadiums except for stadiums having a concert in year 2014.
Generated SQL: SELECT  To generate the correct SQL query, we need to follow these steps:  1. Identify the stadiums that have concerts in the year 2014. 2. Exclude those stadiums from the list of all stadiums.  Here's how you can do it using a `NOT IN` clause or a `LEFT JOIN` with a `WHERE` condition. I'll use the `NOT IN` approach for simplicity:  ```sql SELECT Name  FROM stadium  WHERE Stadium_ID NOT IN (     SELECT Stadium_ID      FROM concert      WHERE Year = 2014 ); ```  This query selects all stadium names except those that have a concert in the year 2014.  I think final SQL QUERY: `SELECT Name FROM stadium WHERE Stadium_ID NOT IN (SELECT Stadium_ID FROM concert WHERE Year = 2014);` didn't extract

Question: How much does the car accelerate that makes amc hornet sportabout (sw)?
Generated SQL: SELECT  To generate the correct SQL query based on the provided schema and question, we need to join multiple tables to find the acceleration of the car model "amc hornet sportabout (sw)". Here's how we can do it:  1. Start with the `model_list` table since it contains the specific model name. 2. Join `car_names` using the `Model` column from `model_list`. 3. Join `cars_data` using the `MakeId` column from `car_names`.  Here is the corrected SQL query:  ```sql SELECT cars_data.Accelerate FROM model_list JOIN car_names ON model_list.Model = car_names.Model JOIN cars_data ON car_names.MakeId = cars_data.Id WHERE model_list.Maker = 'amc' AND model_list.Model = 'hornet sportabout (sw)'; ```  However, there seems to be a mismatch in the join condition between `car_names` and `cars_data`. The correct foreign key relationship is that `car_names.MakeId` should match `car_makers.Id`, and then we can join `car_makers.Id` with `cars_data.Id` if needed. But since `car_names.MakeId` directly links to `cars_data.Id`, the query should be:  ```sql SELECT cars_data.Accelerate FROM model_list JOIN car_names ON model_list.Model = car_names.Model JOIN cars_data ON car_names.MakeId = cars_data.Id WHERE model_list.Maker = 'amc' AND model_list.Model = 'hornet sportabout (sw)'; ```  But to ensure correctness, let's adjust the join conditions properly:  1. Join `model_list` with `car_makers` on `Maker`. 2. Join `car_names` with `model_list` on `Model`. 3. Join `cars_data` with `car_names` on `MakeId`.  Here is the corrected SQL query:  ```sql SELECT cars_data.Accelerate FROM model_list JOIN car_makers ON model_list.Maker = car_makers.Id JOIN car_names ON model_list.Model = car_names.Model JOIN cars_data ON car_names.MakeId = cars_data.Id WHERE car_makers.FullName = 'AMC' AND model_list.Model = 'hornet sportabout (sw)'; ```  I think final SQL QUERY:  ```sql SELECT cars_data.Accelerate FROM model_list JOIN car_makers ON model_list.Maker = car_makers.Id JOIN car_names ON model_list.Model = car_names.Model JOIN cars_data ON car_names.MakeId = cars_data.Id WHERE car_makers.FullName = 'AMC' AND model_list.Model = 'hornet sportabout (sw)'; ``` didn't extract

Question: What is the average edispl of the cars of model volvo?
Generated SQL: SELECT  To generate the correct SQL query based on the provided schema and question, we need to join multiple tables to find the average `Edispl` (engine displacement) for cars of the model "Volvo". Here's how we can do it:  1. **Identify the Tables Involved**:    - `car_makers`: Contains information about car makers.    - `model_list`: Links car makers with their models.    - `car_names`: Contains model names and links to `cars_data`.    - `cars_data`: Contains detailed data about cars, including `Edispl`.  2. **Determine the Joins**:    - Join `model_list` with `car_makers` on `Maker` (from `model_list`) and `Id` (from `car_makers`).    - Join `car_names` with `model_list` on `Model`.    - Join `cars_data` with `car_names` on `MakeId`.  3. **Filter the Data**:    - Filter the results to only include rows where the model is "Volvo".  4. **Calculate the Average**:    - Use the `AVG()` function to calculate the average `Edispl`.  Here's the corrected SQL query:  ```sql SELECT AVG(cars_data.Edispl)  FROM cars_data JOIN car_names ON cars_data.Id = car_names.MakeId JOIN model_list ON car_names.Model = model_list.Model WHERE model_list.Maker = 'Volvo'; ```  However, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the question. The model "Volvo" is actually a maker, not a model. We should filter by the `Maker` instead of `Model`. Let's correct that:  ```sql SELECT AVG(cars_data.Edispl)  FROM cars_data JOIN car_names ON cars_data.Id = car_names.MakeId JOIN model_list ON car_names.Model = model_list.Model JOIN car_makers ON model_list.Maker = car_makers.Id WHERE car_makers.FullName = 'Volvo'; ```  But since the `Maker` in `model_list` is actually referencing the `Id` from `car_makers`, we should filter by `car_makers.Maker` if "Volvo" is the maker's name in `car_makers`. However, typically, `FullName` would be used for full names like 'Volvo'. Let's assume the question meant to filter by `FullName`.  Here is the final SQL query:  ```sql SELECT AVG(cars_data.Edispl)  FROM cars_data JOIN car_names ON cars_data.Id = car_names.MakeId JOIN model_list ON car_names.Model = model_list.Model JOIN car_makers ON model_list.Maker = car_makers.Id WHERE car_makers.FullName = 'Volvo'; ```  I think final SQL QUERY: SELECT AVG(cars_data.Edispl) FROM cars_data didn't extract

Here is the corrected SQL query:  ```sql SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM (     SELECT Country      FROM car_makers      JOIN countries ON car_makers.Country = countries.CountryId      GROUP BY Country      HAVING COUNT(car_makers.Id) > 2 ); ```  I think final SQL QUERY: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT Country FROM car_makers JOIN countries ON car_makers.Country = countries.CountryId GROUP BY Country HAVING COUNT(car_makers.Id) > 2);` didn't extract

Question: Which are the car makers which produce at least 2 models and more than 3 car makers ? List the id and the maker .
Generated SQL: SELECT  To address the question, we need to identify car makers that produce at least 2 different models and ensure that there are more than 3 such car makers. We will use the `car_makers` table for the maker's information and the `model_list` table to count the distinct models produced by each maker.  Here is the corrected SQL query:  ```sql SELECT cm.Id, cm.Maker FROM car_makers cm JOIN model_list ml ON cm.Id = ml.Maker GROUP BY cm.Id, cm.Maker HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT ml.Model) >= 2; ```  However, to ensure that there are more than 3 such car makers, we need a subquery or an additional condition. Since the question asks for the list of car makers and not just the count, we will assume the query should return all car makers meeting the criteria without filtering based on the total number of such car makers.  If you specifically want to ensure that there are more than 3 car makers producing at least 2 models, you would need a more complex query involving a subquery or a `WITH` clause. However, based on the provided question and typical SQL practices for such queries, we will stick with the above query which lists all car makers producing at least 2 models.  I think final SQL QUERY:  ```sql SELECT cm.Id, cm.Maker FROM car_makers cm JOIN model_list ml ON cm.Id = ml.Maker GROUP BY cm.Id, cm.Maker HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT ml.Model) >= 2; ``` didn't extract

Generation Time: 41.3303 seconds
--------------------------------------------------
Question: What are the ids and names of all countries that either have more than 3 car makers or produce fiat model ?
Generated SQL: SELECT  To address the question, we need to construct a query that retrieves country IDs and names for countries meeting two conditions: 1. Countries with more than 3 car makers. 2. Countries producing cars of the 'Fiat' model.  We will use `UNION` to combine results from these two conditions since they are independent but related queries.  Here's the corrected SQL query:  ```sql SELECT c.CountryId, c.CountryName FROM countries c JOIN car_makers cm ON c.CountryId = cm.Country GROUP BY c.CountryId, c.CountryName HAVING COUNT(cm.Id) > 3  UNION  SELECT c.CountryId, c.CountryName FROM countries c JOIN car_makers cm ON c.CountryId = cm.Country JOIN model_list ml ON cm.Id = ml.Maker WHERE ml.Model LIKE '%Fiat%' ```  This query ensures that we get distinct country IDs and names for countries meeting either of the specified conditions. The `UNION` operator automatically handles duplicates, so we don't need to use `DISTINCT`.  I think final SQL QUERY:  ```sql SELECT c.CountryId, c.CountryName FROM countries c JOIN car_makers cm ON c.CountryId = cm.Country GROUP BY c.CountryId, c.CountryName HAVING COUNT(cm.Id) > 3 UNION SELECT c.CountryId, c.CountryName FROM countries c JOIN car_makers cm ON c.CountryId = cm.Country JOIN model_list ml ON cm.Id = ml.Maker WHERE ml.Model LIKE '%Fiat%'; ``` didn't extract

Question: What is average life expectancy in the countries where English is not the official language?
Generated SQL: SELECT  To address the question, we need to find the average life expectancy of countries where English is not the official language. This requires joining the `country` table with the `countrylanguage` table on the `CountryCode` field and filtering out the rows where English is the official language.  Here's the corrected SQL query:  ```sql SELECT AVG(c.LifeExpectancy) FROM country c JOIN countrylanguage cl ON c.Code = cl.CountryCode WHERE cl.Language = 'English' AND cl.IsOfficial = 0; ```  However, the above query filters for countries where English is not official, but it should actually exclude those countries. We need to use a `NOT` condition or a subquery to achieve this.  Here's the corrected SQL query:  ```sql SELECT AVG(c.LifeExpectancy) FROM country c WHERE c.Code NOT IN (     SELECT cl.CountryCode     FROM countrylanguage cl     WHERE cl.Language = 'English' AND cl.IsOfficial = 1 ); ```  This query calculates the average life expectancy of countries where English is not the official language.  I think final SQL QUERY:  ```sql SELECT AVG(c.LifeExpectancy) FROM country c WHERE c.Code NOT IN (     SELECT cl.CountryCode     FROM countrylanguage cl     WHERE cl.Language = 'English' AND cl.IsOfficial = 1 ); ``` didn't extract

Question: What are the ids of students who both have friends and are liked?
Generated SQL: SELECT  To generate the correct SQL query, we need to identify students who appear in both the `Friend` table (as either a student_id or friend_id) and the `Likes` table (as either a student_id or liked_id). Here's how we can construct this query:  1. First, find all unique student IDs from the `Friend` table. 2. Then, find all unique student IDs from the `Likes` table. 3. Finally, use an intersection to get the common student IDs from both sets.  Here is the corrected SQL query:  ```sql SELECT DISTINCT student_id FROM Friend INTERSECT SELECT DISTINCT student_id FROM Likes UNION SELECT DISTINCT liked_id FROM Likes; ```  However, since we need students who are both in `Friend` and either `student_id` or `liked_id` in `Likes`, the correct query should be:  ```sql SELECT DISTINCT student_id FROM Friend INTERSECT (SELECT DISTINCT student_id FROM Likes  UNION  SELECT DISTINCT liked_id FROM Likes); ```  This ensures we get students who have friends and are also involved in likes (either as liker or likee).
